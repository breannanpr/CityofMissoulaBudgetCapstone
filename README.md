## Methodology

The City of Missoula focuses on priority based budgeting practices. This is essential given that many programs are required by various factors. Because this topic is easily misconstrued, here is a summary of frequent terminology used in this project (More detailed definitions available in Appendicies). 


### Key Definitions
- **Program**: City-funded service or function with a 6-digit code, representing a specific output or public-facing activity. 
- **Mandate**: Legally required (federal, state or court-appointed). Does not include contract-based or optional services. 
- **Service Level Requirements (External)**: Rules imposed by external entities (ex., regulatory agencies), even if the program itself isn't mandated.
- **Reliance**: Community dependence or risk of disruption if removed from the community. High reliance = wide usage, few alternatives, or critical outcomes. 
- **Trend**: Indicates whether the program's demand is growing, stable, declining or evolving due to external factors. 
- **Risk**: Assesses potential challenges in the next 1-3 years (ex., funding cuts, staffing issues, legal changes).
- **Cost Recovery**: Indicates whether or not a program experiences any form of cost recovery meaning, a portion of program costs are offset by revenue sources.


### Annual Cleaning and Transformation Process

While the process below is detailed for this repository, ultimately Google Colab was used to perform and carry out the final cleaning pipeline. 

In order to begin a refreshed cycle of visualizing the City of Missoula's Program Inventory data, a City of Missoula employee follow the guidelines and tasks outlined in the supporting **[budget data cleaning documentation](https://github.com/breannanpr/CityofMissoulaBudgetCapstone/blob/main/assets/budget_data_cleaning_procedure_20250502.pdf)**, provided to the city. 

Once the steps are carried out, two cleaned files are uploaded into the the appropriate Sharepoint Site folder: **[Missoula PBI - City Program Inventory Budget Breakdown](https://cityofmissoulagcc.sharepoint.com/sites/MissoulaPBI/CPIBB/Forms/AllItems.aspx)**. After the process is completed in full, the user will have a fully updated interactive dashboard. 

All cleaning is conducted in Python using modular, documented functions that support automation and integration with the Power BI Platform. For a more comprehensive breakdown of each of the steps, please review the ```citydata_01_cleaning.ipynb``` in this repository. 


#### Steps Summary
**Step 1:** Import Libraries Used

```
pandas, numpy                   ## Data wrangling
openpyxl                        ## Excel file I/O
janitor                         ## Header normalization and chaining helpers
tqdm, re, os, chardet           ## Cleaning utilities
missingno, matplotlib.pyplot    ## EDA visual tools
```


**Step 2:** Define Cleaning Functions
- Creating a set of helper functions reduced repetition and provides greater clarity, below are some notable functions used and an explanation of what they do. 

```
drop_unnamed_columns()          ## Removes Excel filler columns

clean_numeric_column()          ## Fixes trailing .0 artifacts

clean_identifiers()             ## standardizes key indentifiers and applies formatting

expand_multicolumn_headers()    ## Converts original clumped "Mandate" column into multiple structured column headers

apply_department_and_fund_mappings() ## easilty identified mappings for city codes

clean_program_inventory()       ## full cleaning pipeline for program inventory data

strip_whitespace_and_standardize() ## Cleans casing and trailing spaces

remove_trailing_underscores()   ## Final polish on column names
```


**Step 3:** Load Raw Files
- Reads in both Excel exports using ```openyxl```


**Step 4:** Expenditure Status Filtering
- Creates six individual filtering conditions on the Expenditure Status file; 
    - Removes subtotal/blank rows
    - Confirms numeric validity
    - Retains specific row and column combinations


**Step 5:** Account Code Decomposition
- Breaks out ```account_number``` within the Expenditure status data into:

```
fund_no,                ## related to four digit fund code

dept_no,                ## related to three digit department code

activity_code,          ## related to six digit unique activity codes

object_code,            ## related to three digit budget object code

sub_object_code         ## related to three digit sub budget object code
```


**Step 6:** Program Inventory Header Expansion
- Converts wide format survey headers (e.g. "Mandate (E41, H41, E43)") into proper named fields


**Step 7:** Clean Program Inventory
- Calls in our ```clean_program_inventory()``` function
- Standardizes IDs (```fund, dept_no, activity```)
- Fills empty responses with "blank" for BI compatibility


**Step 8:** Normalize Column Names
- Converts all columns to ```snake_case``` using ```janitor.clean_names()```
- Removes trailing _ characters
- Applies across both program and revenue workbooks


**Step 9:** Validate Structure

```
missingno.matrix()           ## confirms data completeness

.describe() and .info()      ## checks used on each dataset
```

Spot checks confirm no corrupted rows or null-heavy fields


**Step 10:** Apply Final Mappings
- Merges ```dept_map``` and ```fund_map``` for readability
- Unmapped entries are labeled "unmapped" for visibility


**Step 11:** Export Cleaned Files
- Final files are saved to cleaned_outputs/ for use in:
    - Streamlit Hosted Internal Expenditure Status Training Tool
    - Power BI Dashboard


## Streamlit Digital Product: Internal Training Tool
The Streamlit app allows the user to experience what it is like to be included in the budget planning process in the City of Missoula. Whether you are planning to run for a position on the City Council, aspire to be the Mayor or will be filling a supporting staff role - This tool educates understanding of budget tradeoffs by allocating funds across the four strategic goals; Community Design and Livability, Community Saftety Health and Well-Being, Organizational Excellence and Resilience, and Economic Health using priority-based budgeting practices.

Explore:
- Understanding how program risks, requirements and mandates reduce available budget
- Understanding how strategic goals align with priority-based budgeting
- Understanding the breakdown of what is included in all of the budgeted costs for a program.

## Raw Data to Power BI Pipeline
This partially manual and automatic data cleaning pipeline utilizes Google Colab as a data cleaning processor to host python code in an interactive environment for the employee carrying out the task. 

**1. Beginning Extracting the Raw Data Files**
- Raw .xlsx files (Expenditure Status, Program Inventory) are extracted and saved within the employees desktop. 
    - File format "Expenditure_Status.xlsx" for Expenditure Status. 
    - File Format: "Program_Inventory_Internal_Data_Collection.xlsx" for Program Inventory. 

**NOTE: It is essential that these file names are accurate for the integrity of the data cleaning process. Overwrite existing file when dropping them into the SharePoint Library.**


**2. Navigate to Google Colab for Cleaning and Transformation**
- **[Program Inventory and Expenditure Data Cleaning Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1d5DcpU9pPE3S6YncbMMwBcjf7saI8NgW?usp=sharing)** in Google Colab. 
- Google Colab will prompt the user to upload the required Excel files, then clean the files accordingly to the methodology used in this Repository. 
- Once the cleaning process is complete, the user may download the cleaned .csv files


**3. Upload Clean Data to SharePoint**
- Upload the cleaned files to the correct SharePoint folder **clean_data__outputs**, overwriting any pre-existing data and retaining the correct file names. 

![Screenshot of SharePoint Library View](/assets/sharepoint_library_view.png)


**3. Refresh the Dashboard (Optional)**

Once the files are uploaded properly the Dashboard should reflect the update, however if it does not users may refresh the data sources to showcase the new data visualization.


### Dashboard Features

## Exploratory Analysis and Key Findings
The notebook **[citydata_02_exploratory.ipynb](https://github.com/breannanpr/CityofMissoulaBudgetCapstone/blob/main/citydata_02_exploratory.ipynb)** dives into the cleaned data to identify patterns, ensure data integrity, and inform both the app and dashboard. The respository notebook contains well docummented narrative and breaks this process into a more detailed step-by-step process. 

Exploratory analysis in general is an essential for validating the success of the cleaning process and surfacing analytical insights before building visualizations. The referenced notebook is summarized as follows:

**Step 1: Load Data**
- Both cleaned CSVs are loaded from our ```cleaned_outputs``` file:
- cleaned_expenditure_status.csv
- cleaned_program_inventory.csv
    - ‚úÖ Column names and data types are verified
    - ‚úÖ Expected shapes: ~2,185 expenditure rows, ~378 program rows
    - ‚úÖ Structure aligns with expectations, no null or corrupted columns


**Steps 2 and 3: Data Structure, Health Checks and Summary Statistics**
- Used ```info()``` and ```.describe()``` to assess completeness and distributions.
- Confirmed all key fields (like ```dept_no, adjusted_appropriation, strategic_goal```) are usable.
- Found most columns to be consistent and free of missing data.
- Visual null-check: ```import missingno as msno``` and ```msno.matrix(df_programs)```
    - Quickly confirms that most columns are complete and suitable for grouping and visualization.


**Step 4: Department Budget Trends**
- Aggregated ```adjusted_appropriation``` by ```department``` to highlight areas of high-spend.
    - üü¢ Findings: Several departments (e.g. Fire, Police, Public Works) dominate the budget allocation.


**Step 5: Program Review**
- Explored how resources are spread across programs
- Grouped by ```strategic_goal_e66_name``` and ```risk_e93_type``` to understand complexity
- üü° Insight: Programs tied to housing and infrastructure were most common among strategic alignments.

Example:
```
df_programs['strategic_goal_e66_name'].value_counts().head(10)
```


**Steps 6 through 13: Deeper Dive into Data**
- Budget Allocation Breakdown 
- Mandate, Risk and Trend Distributions
- FTE vs Total Spending 
- Department-level Cost Recovery Overview
- Combined Risk + Mandate Matrix
- Heatmap of Risk and Trend (Demand) 
- Flagging High-Investment and High-Risk Programs


**Summary of Exploratory Insights**
- The cleaning pipeline was validated: no structural errors or major nulls.
- Expenditure is concentrated among a few departments and object types.
- Strategic goals align closely with staffing patterns.
- Risk analysis is a critical lens ‚Äî high-cost programs often carry operational risks.
