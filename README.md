# City of Missoula Budget Capstone Project


## Overview
This is a repository for my capstone project for the City of Missoula's Finance Department. 

Historically, budget reporting and review has been a difficult process to navigate. Gathering data and providing information that is insightful can be a tedious process. The city values and has goals centtered in Housing, Equity and Climate & Resilience. Within these goals, there are some additional focus points that should be given light to: 
1. The city has a mission to ensure that the streets are well-maintained, wastewater and sewage are treated and discharged safely. (Public Works & Mobility)
2. Emergency services respond when they're needed. (Police & Fire)
3. Parks are maintained and welcoming. (Parks & Recreation)
4. Professional organizations that are fiscally responsible, ensure a positive work environment and provides transparent government.  (Administration) 

It is a great mission of Missoula, to enhance transparency and informed decision-making. With the support of Mayor Andrea Davis, the City is working to develop a comprehensive program inventory. The program inventory will allow understanding the basics of each of the City's programs with an accessible summary for each program. "The program summaries will be used to showcase what each program does for our community, how much we invest, and the tangible attributes of each" program. This solution, verbilized by the mayor will demonstrate value for the city and it's constituents. 

## Scope
The scope of this project entails connecting budget data and program inventory information to a dashboard that will be used by the Mayor and the City Council of Missoula to make informed decisions about the budgetary needs and requirements in any given year. In addition to the current year's decision making process, the dashboard will serve as a reflective and interactive tool that can also be used to compare budget data year over year. 


## Data Overview

The data is stored in csv files and excel workbooks located within the Workiva (Wdesk) platform. It is here where survey data is collected and manipulated to create a comprehensive workbook which can be exported from the platform onto a local server. 

The Program Inventory Internal Data Collection file includes each program description in the form of a one page summary with various fields that describe each program. Each document that is summarized within the file has attributes noted in Appendix 1B: City Program Inventory Internal Data Collection Data Columns below. Each document elaborates attributes that align with the definitions in Appendix 1A: Program Inventory Instructions Defnintions. Appendix 1A is a condensed and summarized version of the original document provided by the City of Missoula, please see the assets folder for more information. Each year, the data is collected by the end of March to increase the City's priority-based budgeting goals.

## Appendicies 


### Appendix 1A: Program Inventory Instructions Definitions

1. Program: A city-funded service or function, tracked with a six-digit code in the city's financial system for budgeting and spending. 
2. Program Description: A short summary of what the program does, why it exists and how it serves the community. 
3. Mandate: A program is mandated if federal/state law or court order require the city to provide it. This does not include programs based on city contracts, which can be renegotiated. 
4. Service Requirements Set by Outside Organizations: Even if not legally required, some programs must follow outside rules once they strat. For Example, if the city runs a water system, it must meet safety regulations. 
5. Reliance: Measures how much the community depends on the program. Hight reliance means many people use the program, few alternatives exist or it's removal would cause major disruptions. 
6. Trend: Indicates whether the program's demand is increasing, decreasing, stable or evolving due to changing technology, policies or community needs. 
7. Risk: Evaluates if the program might face challenges within the next 1-3 years due to funding, legal changes, or operational issues like staffing shortages. 
8. Internal Use Information: Some program data (performance, cost analysis and staffing) is used for city planning but not necessarily made public.
