# Progress, Problems and Plans as of January 28, 2025. 
So far to date I have spent 5 hours and 45 minutues on this project so far not including meetings. I've been using a time and project task tracker called Toggl to see how much time I am spending and keep myself accountable as well. This time has been spend familiarizing myself with the data and starting to use the data in power bi. I think I may have jumped the gun and should have just started in python and R, so I will go back this week and do some exploratory analysis BEFORE completing the dashboard draft. I have met with the client to gain further understanding on the ask for the dashboard and what exactly that dashboard should answer in terms of questions. I have also been in touch just getting access to the platforms that the city uses for data transfer and adjustments. This week, I plan to do the exploratory analysis and also see if there is a way to link wdesk to power bi.

# Progress, Problems and Plans for February 2, 2025. 
Progress: I did not make much progress this past week as I am still waiting for access to the API/Connection with PowerBI and WDesk. I will send an email right after I submit this to check in on that particular item. I spent most of my time for this project reviewing approximately 8-10 hours of content for quick refresher courses for the tools I am using such as R, Python, and Power BI. I think this gave me more confidence in working with these tools efficiently. 
Problems: Just having difficulty / taking a bit long to get connected. I will follow up this week and if I don't hear back by this thursday's 1:1 meeting then I would say it's an "issue". 
Plans: This week I will hit that dashboard hard, and mock it up. Spend more time working through the data and really sit down and do a bulk of work.
