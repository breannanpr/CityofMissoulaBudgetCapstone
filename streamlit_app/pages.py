    Welcome to the City of Missoula's interactive training tool. This resource was created to help users understand how budgeted expenditures align with the City's strategic pillars and to provide insight into priority-based budgeting in practice. 
    A few important notes before you being: 
    - This tool presents budgeted expenditures only, not actual spending. 
    - Transfers have been excluded to avoid double counting, and revenues are not shown. 
    - The interactive dashboard data views reflect a single fiscal year at a time. 
    - The information is drawn from program inventory sheets completed by budget managers for every budgeted expenditure across the City.  
    
    While this is not a comprehensive view of the full City budget, it offers valuable context about how resources are allocated to support strategic budget priorities. 
                
    Use the navigation above to explore background context, interact with real program data, and try your hand at making funding decisions!

    This internal training tool is built using real data from the City of Missoula's budget process. It's designed to help staff better understand how the City's values are reflected in budget decisions.

    This tool will help you:
    - Build familiarity with **program-level budgeting**
    - Demonstrate how **strategic priorities influence financial choices**
    - Practice **navigating public data** and consider **budget trade-offs**

    This tool includes visualizations, a hands-on activity, and a lined dashboard with the most recent fiscal year's data.

This interactive dashboard displays program-level budget data alongside key qualitative attributes from the City's program inventory, including:

- Mandates (legal or regulatory requirements)
- Service level requirements set by third parties
- Community reliance
- Trends in service demand
- Program risk and sustainability
- Alignment with strategic priorities

Use the slicers and filters to explore how budgeted expenditures relate to these attributes. This will help build context before you dive into the training activity.

    Now it's your turn to allocate some of the remaining funding across the City of Missoula's four strategic pillars. 
    
    Keep in mind that in the dashboard you were able to see how nearly half of the City's total budget is already committed to mandated services and legally required obligations, your task is to decide how to allocate the remaining resources.
    
    As you make your choices, you'll receive immediate feedback on how your budget reflects City priorities, highlighting potential trade-offs, risks, and areas of alignment.
