# Progress, Problems and Plans for April 1, 2025

Progress: I've completely scrapped the project. 

Just kidding. A lot was accomplished this past weekend. The data is finally in a state of workability, some analysis and work was conducted surrounding the exploratory analysis and the first draft of the digital product is complete. There is a good amount of work to be done on this and then finishing the dashboard. 

Problems: None currently to report. 

Plans: Finish functionality and content within the digital product and finalize the dashboard for review. 

Hours This Week: 18:07:36

# Progress, Problems and Plans for March 25, 2025

Progress: After meeting last friday, I think I missed an important step of the cleaning process so this week am just working on adjusting that and I think we are nearly done with the cleaning of the files. I also made significant changes to the structure of my github repository in preparation for deadlines due this coming Sunday. I have more work to do but I think this infrastructure currently suits the project. 

Problems: None currently aside from trying to decide what the best digital product would be for this project and information. My aspirations and current time limitations are not aligning so I might just make it simple but this is the current "problem". 

Plans: Complete the cleaning with new steps, complete more repository updates for code, submit the code samples and work on the digital product. I still have yet to put the raw files in sharepoint and get this set up but I think this can be accomplished quickly once code is finished with pre-visualization preparations.

# Progress, Problems and Plans for March 18, 2025

Progress: Finally was able to figure out a piece of the code I had been wanting to update. I accidentally created two colummns with the same name. This issue has been fixed but now, there are a few more formatting for cleaning the data and preparing it for data visualization as well. There were also some updates to the code where I need to thoroughly examine all the reference accounts for the city and then label them into a data map for the information to be cleaned and categorized appropriately. This took up most of my weekend and I think I am nearly there with figuring it all out. 

Problems: Currently, working on procrastinating. I have found I will do a large stint of time working on this project then set it down for a day or two before I pick it back up. If I pick up the project more frequently I will be able to make more progress and finally finish the parts I am stuck trying to finish. This is a new goal for this upcoming week. 

Plans: Same as last week, but setting a deadline more firm in order to finish cleaning the data. Once complete, I will be able to work on ensuring Power BI points to the correct files, and cleans them appropriately. This will involve migrating my python code to power bi and having power bi do the cleaning of the files and grab the correct files, and then display them in the dashboard. 

Hours This Week: 9:06:23

# Progress, Problems and Plans for March 11, 2025

Progress: Made significant progress with cleaning raw data, the data is nearly workable in powerbi. I am using python to clean the files and prepare them for use. This has so far involved creating and naming functions and then calling them into the process. I am running into a bit of trouble with one of the columns and cleaning it property. I think I may just need to double check my work to ensure that the way I am going about it is the most efficient and best way so far. 

Problems: I am stuck with one column, the trouble is since the data may or may not be present and that is a valid thing, I am unsure of what to do to "clean" this column. In order to create an effective relational diagram, I may need to manually adjust some of the data which I am trying to avoid. I will press into this code further I may just needed to have taken a step back to think about it. 

Plans: Continue to prepare and finish cleaning the data. Once this is complete, I will be able to work on ensuring Power BI points to the correct files, and cleans them appropriately.

# Progress, Problems and Plans for March 4, 2025

Progress: This past week, I was able to look into automation from sharepoint to powerbi and am currently exploring powerbi data cleaning. I believe I can just use scripts when the data is pulled. I got access to the data from Eden and the raw data from the survey. It's pretty messy so I began working on cleaning it. 

Problems: In the thick of it with automation. I feel like it's just either not clicking in my head or I don't understand how this will work. I think I have a solution but need to learn a bit more about how it works outside of theory. Also working through how to effectively clean the data in powerbi, I am used to just using R or python for this and I think I can do it that way but there are more steps that I am still grasping my head around. Confused about DAX in BI and if that is relevant for this project - I am thinking it is. 

Plans: Finish cleaning the data, get it set up in sharepoint and adjust more of the dashboard. Meet with prof for 1:1 to discuss progress and then keep working. 

Hours This Week: I keeep forgetting to add this so I also updated it for the past weeks. Still using Togl to track my time for this project. 5:15:00 (So far an accumulation of approximately 35-40 hours as some of the time I accidentally forgot to track in the beginning).

# Progress, Problems and Plans for February 25, 2025

Progress: This past week, I made significant progress on setting the dashboard. I was able to meet with client to confirm direction was good, and they loved it so far. We are on the right track. I discovered that there is additional data needed however, so that will go into the "problems section" for elaboration. I was also able to get access to sharepoint and spent time figuring out how to automate. I think I have a decent strategy to focus on in the next few weeks but would like to discuss it more. 

Problems: There is additional data from their financial accounting system platform that is updated nightly to pull pieces of budget information. Client specified the drill down of "where exactly funds were going" so that the public could really see and transparancy can be more deliberate. This data was "included" in the management review but is not in a workable format. In order to get the data in another / second data set we can manually enter a query in the excel workbook or find a way around that. There is a way to query the financial budget data platform and include it in the nightly update / distribution. Need to spend time diving into that part of the platform as it will open up greater possibilities. 

Plans: This week plan to really "finish" the data access here, and see if that query could be written quickly or the best way to go about this. Can discuss in 1:1 meetings this week. 

Hours This Week: 7:55:51

# Progress, Problems and Plans for February 18, 2025

Progress: This past week, a backup plan was set into motion to create a sharepoint location for the power bi dashboard to link to. Upon having a meeting to discuss the process of how automation works in their instance of workiva it was determined that they would need to pay more to connect a chain directly to power bi. Since it's an annual report that needs to be done, it would be okay to rework the current state of the data and then implement it differently by creating autmations on power bi's side by pointing it to the correct folder in order to display the dashboard. 

Problems: Connecting and implementing the pull appears to be an issue but I think this solution that was created is a good plan to set into motion. Currently I am waiting on access to sharepoint to test and esure the connection works.

Plans: I have sent some emails for follow up meetings and am in the process of preparing the data for the dashboard and confirming a few odd ends for the data dictionary and data understanding.

# Progress, Problems and Plans for February 11, 2025

Progress: This past week I was able to gain access to the chains and data prep section of wdesk/workiva platforms. In addition, I've discovered that chains could be used to automate certain linear tasks. There is also a confirmed way to connect wdesk/workiva to PowerBI for the dashboard - however see problem for more. Much of this past week has been spent going through documentation; planning out the steps to perform a test of connection or chain; familiarizing myself with the platform and the city's current set up; and creating a few mock ups for the dashboard. I did not make much progress on the creation of the dashboard because I was focusing on the connection aspect first. 

Problems: While there is a confirmed way to connect powerbi to wdesk/workiva, it doesn't seem it's enabled for the city. Others are, but not power bi, I am thinking that I will need to write a script in python to connect them. This needs a bit further investigation. In addition to the first issue, when it comes to the actual data, I am confused about how they are defining each variable and what those variables encompass. I think it would be beneficial to create a data dictionary to further explain how the data is laid out and if there are certain known fields for greater analysis. I did have a meeting where the most important variables are outlined, so there is a start to this process but it is not complete. This is something that should be done and would help with the draft of the dashboard for which kpis to put in that make the most sense. 

Plans: I am sending an email to Buck in the morning to ask a couple questions before I perform the test in workiva to see if the chain will work (I'm unsure of the city's usage limits and would like to confirm I am not going to disrupt any current chains by mistake). I am finishing up my draft of the dashboard this and next week (preferably by the end of this working week - but giving myself room for errors and adjustments). I will also plan to continue to work on creating / confirming a data dictionary this week as well.

Hours This Week: 2:08:24

# Progress, Problems and Plans for February 2, 2025

Progress: I did not make much progress this past week as I am still waiting for access to the API/Connection with PowerBI and WDesk. I will send an email right after I submit this to check in on that particular item. I spent most of my time for this project reviewing approximately 8-10 hours of content for quick refresher courses for the tools I am using such as R, Python, and Power BI. I think this gave me more confidence in working with these tools efficiently. 

Problems: Just having difficulty / taking a bit long to get connected. I will follow up this week and if I don't hear back by this thursday's 1:1 meeting then I would say it's an "issue". 

Plans: This week I will hit that dashboard hard, and mock it up. Spend more time working through the data and really sit down and do a bulk of work. 

Hours This Week: 1 hour

# Progress, Problems and Plans as of January 28, 2025

So far to date I have spent 5 hours and 45 minutues on this project so far not including meetings. I've been using a time and project task tracker called Toggl to see how much time I am spending and keep myself accountable as well. This time has been spend familiarizing myself with the data and starting to use the data in power bi. I think I may have jumped the gun and should have just started in python and R, so I will go back this week and do some exploratory analysis BEFORE completing the dashboard draft. I have met with the client to gain further understanding on the ask for the dashboard and what exactly that dashboard should answer in terms of questions. I have also been in touch just getting access to the platforms that the city uses for data transfer and adjustments. This week, I plan to do the exploratory analysis and also see if there is a way to link wdesk to power bi. 

Hours This Week: Jan 1 - Jan 28, 2025: 11:02:41 hours on project.
